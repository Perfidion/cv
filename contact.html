  <h1>How To Contact Me</h1>
  <p>I'd really rather you didn't, to be honest. I'm tired, and irritable, and not predisposed to entertaining the addled whimsies of slack-jawed crotch-fondlers on the internet. However, let it never be said that I am not generous with my time, even to the wretched and undeserving.</p>
  <p>You may endeavour to contact me at the following e-mail address:</p>
  <a href="mailto: mrwibble@hotmail.com">E-mail</a>
  <p>I may even deign to respond provided my mush-brained manservant, Wilkins, brings it to my attention. He is incredibly old and, I believe, afflicted with some form of dementia. Damnably inconvenient.</p>
  <p>Oh, and kindly refrain from saturating my inbox with photos of your inadequate genitalia. If you're determined to humiliate yourself, I can't stop you, but it is an appalling waste of bandwidth and you're not impressing anyone. I'm 107 years old, give or take, so I'm really not sure what you're attempting to accomplish.</p>
