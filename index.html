  <!-- Because basic HTML is not sufficiently confusing and/or annoying, we have 'semantic HTML', which means tags like <em> which italicise content are used 'semantically' -- for the purpose of meaning, as opposed to styling, which is done in CSS. Remember, the internet is for everyone, including the blind and the deaf. -->

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Born in the poisonous quagmire of Mucksludge Pike to a syphilitic prostitute and an indolent drunkard, I spent my formative years setting fire to things and telling horrendous lies. Deciding to make the most of my well-established criminal proclivities, I determined to enter local politics and was elected to council in 2002 on a platform of thrashing the unemployed with barbed wire flails, and increasing taxes on anyone who didn't employ a nanny or own at least one Bentley.</p>
  <p>In 2008, I was introduced to Marjorie Stewart-Baxter, the hateful shrew becoming my wife the following year. She has so far disgorged two bone-idle wasters from between her corpulent thighs, and I have recently undergone a vasectomy in order to prevent this revolting occurrence from ever happening again. I despise my children almost as much as they loathe me, and it is my fondest wish they die cold and alone in a gutter somewhere far from my doorstep. I have taken steps to disinherit them, leaving all my worldly possessions to my cat, Jenkins, who has proven a steadfast companion for the past ten years.</p>
